Test cases built in Robot Framework


Robot Framework - version 3.1.2
Python - version 3.8.2

-- Disclaimer -- 
  * Locators for elements in PO/DownloadMobile.robot are used with the complete and non-improved xpath. This makes readability harder, but was just used for testing un parameterized test cases.
  * Locators for elements in PO/CaredPricesList.robot use better an improved locator approach and are mostly parameterized.
